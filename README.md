# ReflectionUsesExperiment
This is a browser for reflective methods uses and assessing their relevance.

To run the experiment, install this repository's baseline and browse `ReflectionUsesBrowser`. On  class side there is an `example` method that can be run.
This will open the reflection use browser for the selectors `#nextInstance` and |#allInstances`. These can be changed in the `example` method.
